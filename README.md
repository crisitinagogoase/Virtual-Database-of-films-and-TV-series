# Virtual-Database-of-films-and-TV-series
Developed a small program in Java + JavaFX with which it was possible to  manage a database of movies and TV series. It had the following features: 
- adding a new movie to the database.
- deleting a movie based on its unique identification ID.
- A search functionality to find movies in the database based on their name, director, genre, or actors.
- A button to change the status of a movie to watched or not watched.
-A way to view all the movies that have been watched already and their viewing date.
Used Map to store the records of the database. Used the same Map for all operations (display, search, update, delete, etc.) }
